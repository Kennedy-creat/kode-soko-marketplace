# Welcome to Kode Soko!

## What is Kode Soko?

Kode Soko is a special marketplace for mobile apps. It's different because it doesn't have big bosses controlling everything. Instead, it lets Kenyan creators like you publish and sell your apps directly to users. That means you get more control and more money for your hard work!

## Why is Kode Soko Important?

Big app stores have a lot of problems. They can be mean places with bad stuff, and it's hard for new ideas to shine. Kode Soko wants to change that! We want everyone to have a fair chance to share their apps and make the world a better place.

## Our Goals

**Making Friends:** We want Kode Soko to be a friendly place where people can chat, share ideas, and help each other.

**Clean Cities:** We care about the environment and want to help make cities cleaner and safer for everyone.

**Learning Made Fun:** Learning should be fun and easy for everyone. That's why we want to create cool tools to help you learn new things in exciting ways.
